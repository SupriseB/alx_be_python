#Task Description:
#Create a Python script named class_static_methods_demo.py. In this script, define a class Calculator that includes both a class method and a static method to perform calculations. This task aims to illustrate when and how to use @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators, highlighting their differences and practical applications.
#class_static_methods_demo.py:
#Calculator Class:
#Static Method - add(a, b): Returns the sum of two numbers. Use the @staticmethod decorator.
#Class Method - multiply(cls, a, b): Returns the product of two numbers. Use the @classmethod decorator and ensure it prints a class attribute named calculation_type before performing the multiplication.
#Class Attribute:
#Define a class attribute calculation_type with a value of "Arithmetic Operations" that the multiply class method will reference.

class Calculator:
    calculation_type = "Arithmetic Operations"

    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @classmethod
    def multiply(cls, a, b):
        print(f"Calculation type: {cls.calculation_type}")
        return a * b
    
from class_static_methods_demo import Calculator

def main():
    # Using the static method
    sum_result = Calculator.add(10, 5)
    print(f"The sum is: {sum_result}")

    # Using the class method
    product_result = Calculator.multiply(10, 5)
    print(f"The product is: {product_result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
